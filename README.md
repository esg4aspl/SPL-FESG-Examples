# SPL-FESG-Examples

In this repository, examples of product lines have been modelled by using Featured Event Sequence Graphs (FESG). A Featured ESG (FESG) is an extended ESG that is composed of a core ESG (c-ESG) and a set of feature ESGs (f-ESGs). The core of the product line represents the common behavior which exists in all products that belong to bank account product line. The core behavior is modelled using core ESG (c-ESG). An optional behavior is modelled using a feature ESG (f-ESG).

A Featured ESG is used in test sequence composition approach which composes the sequences of core and feature ESGs and generates a product's test sequences. In the most basic, this approach generates the event sequences of the core ESG and the feature ESGs and then, it composes these sequences to generate a product configuration's test sequences. The sequences are composed thanks to the connection points i.e., (esgName,eventName) in the feature ESG(f-ESG) models' events.
