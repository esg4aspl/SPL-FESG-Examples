# Email Product Line 

Email product line has 5 features and a core feature. The core of the product line represents the common behavior which exists in all products that belong to email product line. The core behavior is modelled using core ESG (c-ESG). An optional behavior is modelled using a feature ESG (f-ESG). A featured ESG (FESG) is an extended ESG that is composed of a core ESG (c-ESG) and a set of feature ESGs (f-ESGs). A featured ESG is used in test sequence composition approach which composes the sequences of core and feature ESGs and generates a product's test sequences. The models of email product line are built from the users' perspective. The Event Sequence graphs' events are selected from user events.

## Feature Model

![Feature Model](https://github.com/esg4aspl/SPL-FESG-Examples/blob/master/Email/EmailPL_ModelImages/EmailPL_featureModel.PNG)\
This feature model has 5 optional features. The features _encrypt_ and _forward_ cannot belong to the same product at the same time. 24 different product configurations could be obtained by combining these features of the feature model.

## Email Products
There are 24 product configurations in Email Product Line. In the table below, the product id and the belonging features are given. Since, each possible product does not have a unique official name, we assign IDs to products to name them uniquely.

| Product ID | Features                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |

# Email Product Line Features
## Core ESG (c-ESG)
 ![core](https://github.com/esg4aspl/SPL-FESG-Examples/blob/master/Email/EmailPL_ModelImages/core.PNG)\
 The core ESG of the Email product line represents core features, which exist in all product configurations. For this product line the core feature is composing a new email, sending an email and receiving an email. Note that, the product that has the ID 0, has only core feature since the core feature itself, is capable of generating test sequences.\

## Addressbook Feature ESG (f-ESG)

# Email Product Line Test Generation and Execution
The Email Product Line has 24 product configurations and 52 one-increment, i.e., one feature addition, testing scenarios in total. In our study, we select 30 of the testing scenarios randomly. In the selection process of the one increment scenarios, the following two rules are applied:
1.	The same scenario has not been selected more than once.	
2.	The same PUC has not been selected more than twice.

## Testing Scenarios
In this table, the selected testing scenarios are given with their Scenario IDs, Product Under Consideration(PUC) IDs, Existing Product IDs and Features and Increment. Existing Product refers to the product that we already have the model and the test sequences. In incremental test generation approach, the existing product's test sequences and increment's test sequences are composed so that the test sequences of the PUC is obtained without generating and composing all of its features from scratch. 

| Scenario ID | Product Under Consideration ID | Existing Product ID | Existing Product Features           | New Feature     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------- |

## Data on Number of Faults
The table below contains the total number of possible faults and the number of faults seeded for various m values for each PUC. The entire number of possible faults for each PUC for a given value of m is directly proportional to the number of m-sequences in the PUC's ESG, and the total number of seeded faults is 20% of the summation of number of possible faults for m=2,3,4,5.
