The core behavior is modelled using core ESG (c-ESG).An optional behavior is modelled using a feature ESG (f-ESG). A featured ESG (FESG) is an extended ESG that is composed of a core ESG (c-ESG) and a set of feature ESGs (f-ESGs). A featured ESG is used in test sequence composition approach which composes the sequences of core and feature ESGs and generates a product's test sequences.
