# Elevator Product Line

Elevator product line has three features and a core feature. 

Remember that the core of the product line represents the common behavior which exists in all products that belong to Elevator Product Line. The core behavior is modelled using core ESG (c-ESG).An optional behavior is modelled using a feature ESG (f-ESG).

## Feature Model
![Feature Model](https://github.com/esg4aspl/SPL-FESG-Examples/blob/master/Elevator/ElevatorModelImages/ElevatorPL_FeatureModel.png)\
This feature model has three optional features. The features overloaded and executive floor imply weight. This means that a product configuration which has one of the implying features i.e. overloaded and executive floor must have the feature weight. Different product configurations could be obtained by combining these features. 

## Core ESG (c-ESG)
 ![core](https://github.com/esg4aspl/SPL-FESG-Examples/blob/master/Elevator/ElevatorModelImages/core.png)
 The core ESG of the elevator product line represents core features, which exist in all product configurations. For this product line the core features are calling the elevator, waiting leaving people, entering the elevator, pressing the target floor's button and leaving the elevator.\

  ## Weight Feature ESG (f-ESG)
 ![weight](https://github.com/esg4aspl/SPL-FESG-Examples/blob/master/Elevator/ElevatorModelImages/weight.png)
The users of an elevator trigger weight sensor when they enter and leave the elevator if the elevator has the weight feature. \

   ## Overloaded Feature ESG (f-ESG)
 ![overloaded](https://github.com/esg4aspl/SPL-FESG-Examples/blob/master/Elevator/ElevatorModelImages/overloaded.png)
The users of an elevator hear the overloaded alarm and leave the elevator.\

   ## Executive Floor Feature ESG (f-ESG)
 ![executiveFloor](https://github.com/esg4aspl/SPL-FESG-Examples/blob/master/Elevator/ElevatorModelImages/executivefloor.png)
An elevator requires a password to reach the executive floor if the elevator is equipped with executive floor feature.\
